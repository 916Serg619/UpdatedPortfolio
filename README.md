For this assignment, I had to update my portfolio.  I did this using html, css, and  javascript.  I also added a link to my resum√©, as well as links to my projects that I have worked on in the passed.  I chose to go a completely different route from my original design, adding in some various jQuery effects and actions.  There is still more to be done with my portfolio, but the majority of what I want has been constructed.  If screenshots do not populate within the Read.me, there is a folder within the Assets folder that will direct you to my examples.
